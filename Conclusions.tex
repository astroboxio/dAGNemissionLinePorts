\section{Summary \& Conclusions}

We have studied the $\text{SFR}$ for 149 candidate (double-peaked) Type II dual AGN utilising the sample produced by \cite{Liu_2009} SDSS catalogue of galaxies, focusing on the star-formation and stellar history properties. Specifically, we measure the SFR of both our dual Type II AGN sample and our control Type II AGN sample using the $\text{[O II]}$ $\lambda3727$ line luminosity, correcting for an underlying AGN component by utilising the methods as detailed by \cite{Ho_2005}, \cite{Kim_2006} and \cite{Silverman_2009}). We supplement the study of the instantaneous SFR with properties that trace the star-formation history, notably the $\text{D}_{n}(4000)$ spectral index, and also the stellar mass from which the specefic star-formation rate ($\text{sSFR}$; $\log{(\text{SFR}/M_{*})}$) can be ascertained.
