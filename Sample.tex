The \cite{Ge_Hu_Wang_Bai_Zhang_2012} candidate dAGN population sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS II) Data Release 7 (DR7) forms the basis of our targetary survey. Their dAGN hunt focused on galaxies observed in the optical wavelength by the Apache Point Observatory 2.5-m wide-angle telescope. Analysis conducted by \cite{Ge_Hu_Wang_Bai_Zhang_2012} conducted on 927,552 galaxy spectra from the SDSS DR7 MPA-JHU5 database\footnote{\tiny{Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysik/John Hopkins University Data Release 7 (MPA/JHU5 DR7) reference: \tt{http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/}.}} SDSS-DR7 [\cite{2009ApJS..182..543A}] using the emission-line measurements of $\text{H}\alpha$, $\text{[O III]}$ and $\text{H}\beta$ found a total of 3030 double-peaked narrow-emission line galaxies (NELs) and 12,582 with asymmetric, top-ﬂat proﬁles with a $\text{S/N}$ ratios ${>}{9}$ and equivalent widths EW($\text{H}\alpha$, $\text{H}\beta$, or $\text{[O III]}$) ${>}{3}$\AA. The nature of the emission-line profiles were then extracted with STARLIGHT\footnote{\tiny{The SEAGal/STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code: \tt{http://astro.ufsc.br/starlight/}}} with a combination of narrow Gaussian, broad Balmer and $\text{[O III]}$ winged fits. The selection methods for the Ge+2012 sample is outlined in detail in §2 of \cite{Ge_Hu_Wang_Bai_Zhang_2012}. The entirity of the Ge+2012 population sample can be found at: \tt{[http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJS/201/31]}.

Of the total initial Ge+2012 sample of 15611 objects, we target our analysis on 3841 objects designated as Ge+2012 Type 2 AGN by the emission-line analysis of the MPA-JHU DR7 ($\sim{0.4}$\% of the total MPA-JHU5 SDSS galaxy sample), i.e., objects which are confirmed binary Type II Seyferts within the low-redshift range (e.g., $0.00824{<}z{<}0.37712$; with galaxy velocity dispersions, $\sigma$ (km s$^{-1}$), ranging from 44.10 to 500).
