\label{Emission} \ref{Emission}. (a): Spectra of an early-type double-peaked Type II AGN in the optical range between $4700-6700Å$ showing the main four emission-lines utilised for the diagnostic BPT (Baldwin, Phillips \& Terlevich; [\cite{Baldwin_1981}]) diagram (i.e., $\text{H}\beta$ $\lambda4863Å$, $\text{[O III]}$ $\lambda5007Å$, $\text{H}\alpha$ $\lambda6565Å$ and $\text{[N II]}$ $\lambda6584Å$); and (b): a late-type double-peaked Type II AGN. Both spectra correspond to the same SDSS targets from \ref{Continuum}. We add our own axis break between $5200Å$ and $6200Å$. We note is considerable asymmetry which present in the spectra of (a) which is considered to be a key feature of dual AGN. (N.B. Spectral component fits have not been shown).
