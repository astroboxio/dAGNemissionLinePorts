\label{Silverman} \ref{Silverman}. (a): Relationship between $\log{L_{\text{[O III]}}}$ and $\log{L_{\text{[O II]}}}$ for our candidate dual AGN sample highlighting that more luminous objects (in both $\text{[O II]}$ and $\text{[O III]}$) exhibit younger stellar populations. Also shown is the line highlighting $\log{L_{\text{[O III]}}}=\log{L_{\text{[O II]}}}$; (b): the same relationship with ${L_{\text{[O II]}}}$ converted to the $\text{SFR}_{\text{[O II]}}$ on a logarithmic scale. Again, as \ref{Brinchmann}, we demarcate our sample according to the $\text{D}_{n}(4000)$ spectral index.
