\label{Spectra} \textbf{Figure} \ref{Spectra}. Example spectra of double-peaked Type II AGNs. The dashed vertical lines are drawn at the systemic redshift of each galaxy as measured from stellar absorption features, where the light grey regions depict the blue and red continuum ranges for the $4000Ã…$ break and the dark grey region depicts the $\text{H}\delta_{A}$ index continuum range.
