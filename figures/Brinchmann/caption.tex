\label{Brinchmann} \textbf{Figure} \ref{Brinchmann}. (I): Relationship between the $\text{D}_{n}(4000)$ spectral index and the specific star formation, $\log{(\text{SFR}_{\text{[O II]}}/M_{*})}$ with accompanying ordinary least squares (OLS) regression at 95\% confidence and multivariate regressions.  (II): measured $\text{[O II]}\,\lambda{3727}Å$ strength relative to the $\text{[O III]}\,\lambda{5007}Å$ flux as a function of the stellar age indicator, $\text{D}_{n}(4000)$. (III): Conditional dependence of the star formation history, i.e., the specific star formation $\log{(\text{SFR}_{\text{[O II]}}/M_{*})}$, on the stellar mass, $\log{(M_{*})}$, for both our control Type II single AGN sample and for our Type II AGN with double-peaked emission lines, demarcated according to the measured $\lambda{4000}Å$ break index.
