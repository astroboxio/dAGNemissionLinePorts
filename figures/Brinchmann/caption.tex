\label{Brinchmann} \ref{Brinchmann}. (a): Relationship between the the specific star formation, $\log{(\text{SFR}_{\text{[O II]}}/M_{*})}$ and the $\text{D}_{n}(4000)$ spectral index with accompanying ordinary least squares (OLS) regression at 95\% confidence and multivariate regressions; (b): Conditional dependence of the star formation history, i.e., the specific star formation $\log{(\text{SFR}_{\text{[O II]}}/M_{*})}$, on the stellar mass, $\log{(M_{*})}$, for both our control Type II single AGN sample and for our Type II AGN with double-peaked emission lines, demarcated according to the measured $\lambda{4000}Å$ break index; (c): measured $\text{[O II]}\,\lambda{3727}Å$ strength relative to the $\text{[O III]}\,\lambda{5007}Å$ flux as a function of the $\text{[O III]}\lambda5007Å$ luminosity. The large triangle marks the location of the sample of type 2 quasars from \ref{Zakamska_2003}.
