\label{KolmogorovSmirnov} \textbf{Figure} \ref{KolmogorovSmirnov}. The plots shows the the two-sample Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov statistic for our dual AGN and Type II AGN. The D value is of 0.38 with a p-value of $5.49\times10^{-8}$ of rejection of the null hypothesis. This clearly shows that the dAGN come from a different population.
