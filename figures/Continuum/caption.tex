\label{Continuum} \ref{Continuum}. (a): Spectra for an example early-type (i.e., $\text{D}_{n}(4000)={0.885}$) confirmed Binary AGN ($z={0.181612}$, SDSS J110851.04+065901.4); and (b): an example late-type (i.e., $\text{D}_{n}(4000)={1.941}$) double-peaked Type II AGN ($z={0.077341}$, SDSS J094427.59+144717.1). Both spectra are plotted in the rest-frame range $3700-4700Å$. The regions shown indicate the narrower \cite{Balogh_1999} $\text{D}_{n}(4000)$ bandpass (light gray indicating the blue and red continua), the pseudocontinua for the $\text{H}\delta_{A}$ bandpass (dark gray) and the $\text{H}\delta_{A}$ bandpass (hatched region). We also mark the ($\text{[Ca II]}$ $H$ \& $K$) rest-frame absorptions lines at 396.85 and 393.37 nm, which are synonymous with elliptical galaxies containing older, cooler stars with little free dust and gas and negligible massive star formation. We also highlight the $\text{[Ne III]} \lambda{3868}Å$ which is a relatively strong emission-line in Type II AGN spectra and also the SFR indicator $\text{[O II]} \lambda{3728}Å$ doublet.
