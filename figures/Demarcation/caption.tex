\label{BPT-Kewley} \textbf{Figure} \ref{BPT-Kewley}. A diagnostic BPT (Baldwin, Phillips \& Terlevich; [\cite{Baldwin_1981}]) diagram for our dAGN sample, using spectroscopic data from the SDSS III DR10. The main plot shows the $\log(\text{[O III]}/\text{H}\beta)$ vs. $\log(\text{[N II]}/\text{H}\alpha)$ plot for our original Ge+2012 dAGN sample designated as Type II in the original SDSS DR7 data. All main dividing lines are shown, e.g., the \cite{Kewley_Dopita_Sutherland_Heisler_Trevena_2001} extreme-starburst line (solid) and the \cite{Kauffmann_2003} demarcation line (dotted), as well as the \cite{Stasinska_2006} demarcation line (dotted-dashed). We also include our firm AGN region as those objects falling within the region classified by $\log(\text{[O III]}/\text{H}\beta)>{0.490}$ and $\log(\text{[N II]}/\text{H}\alpha)>{-0.220}$. The diagnostic plot is underlayed with our control sample from the SDSS galaxy merger catalogue as described in Darg et al. (2010) as a comparative illustration.
