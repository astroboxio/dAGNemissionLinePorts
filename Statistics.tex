In order to better understand the star-formation properties of dual AGN we select three distinct groups to analyse. Firstly, we have our control sample of Type II AGN with $\log{([O III]/H\beta)}>{6.9}$; which we feel can act as archetypal narrow-line AGN sample from which we gain gain context for the Type II candidate dual AGN sample. Coupled to the two main samples, we also add a third: tidal (interacting), binary and dual-cored AGN candidates that we take from the literature, and that coincide and can be cross-referenced with objects within the Liu+2010 parent dual AGN sample. With this in mind, we firstly look towards the amount of the $\text{[O II]}$ $\lambda\lambda$$3727.09$, $3729.88$\AA\AA{} and $\text{H}\alpha$ integrated flux (in units of erg s${^-1}$ cm$^{-2}$) relative to the integrated flux of the $\text{[O III]}$ $\lambda$$5008.24$\AA{}
