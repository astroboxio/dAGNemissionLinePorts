\subsubsection{Population vs. Control Results}

In order to better understand the star-formation properties of dual AGN we select three distinct groups to analyse. Firstly, we have our control sample of Type II AGN with $\log{(\text{[O III]}/\text{H}\beta)}>{6.9}$; which we feel can act as archetypal narrow-line AGN sample from which we gain gain context for the Type II candidate dual AGN sample. Coupled to the two main samples, we also add a third: tidal\footnote{\tiny{Objects classified as tidally interacting taken from \cite{Liu_2011}.}} (interacting), binary\footnote{\tiny{kpc-scale binary AGNs of comparable luminosities, with a relative orbital velocity $\gtrsim{150}$ km s$^{-1}$ taken from \cite{Shen_Liu_Greene_Strauss_2011}.}} and visually confirmed dual-cored AGN candidates taken from \cite{Ge_Hu_Wang_Bai_Zhang_2012}, and that coincide and can be cross-referenced with objects within our Liu+2010 parent dual AGN sample. With this in mind, we firstly look towards the amount of the $\text{[O II]}$ $\lambda\lambda$$3727.09$, $3729.88$\AA\AA{} and $\text{H}\alpha$ integrated flux (in units of erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$) relative to the integrated flux of the $\text{[O III]}$ $\lambda$$5008.24$\AA. These ratios are important in both our understanding of the star-formation properties of the host galaxies of dual AGN, and the contamination of these particular-emission lines from the dual AGN contribution.

Our analysis of the $\text{[O II]/[O III]}$ ratio for single Type II AGN sample yielded the following statistical results: a 2nd quartile i.e., median, $\tilde{x}$ of 0.2318; standard deviation $\sigma_{X}$ of 0.1402 with a cleaned mean, $\mu$, (i.e., excluded outliers within one standard deviation of the median) of 0.1727 and an uncleaned mean of 0.2681. We also report an average absolute deviation around the median of 0.1030, and minimum and maximum values of 0.0836 and 0.7053, respectively. For a desired confidence level of 95\% for the mean quoted, the corresponding confidence interval is ${0.2403}<{\mu}<{0.2956}$. However, if we exclude all \textit{Tukey outliers} (i.e., those objects which are greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the third quartile or below the first quartile) for this sample we can quote a 95\% confidence level of ${0.2311}<{\mu}<{0.2809}$.

We applied the same statistical analyses for our Liu+2010 candidate dual AGN sample and to our tidal, binary and dual-cored AGN candidates. Firstly, our analysis of the Type II AGN with double-peaked emission-lines sample yielded the following statistical results: a $\tilde{x}$ of 0.3354; $\sigma_{X}$ of 0.2541 with a $\mu_{c}$ of 0.2771 and a $\mu$ of 0.3988. We also report an average absolute deviation around the median of 0.1450, and minimum and maximum values of 0.1125 and 2.1492, respectively. For a desired confidence level of 95\% for the mean quoted, the corresponding confidence interval is ${0.3584}<{\mu}<{0.4407}$. Further to our statistical analyses for our Type II AGN with double-peaked emission-lines sample, if we were to isolate those objects within our parent sample designated as tidally interacting, binary or dual-cored AGN we quote a $\tilde{x}$ of 0.4594; $\sigma_{X}$ of 0.3041 with a $\mu_{c}$ of 0.3504 and a $\mu$ of 0.5241. We also report an average absolute deviation around the median of 0.2110, with minimum and maximum values of 0.2319 and 1.3832, respectively. Again, for a desired confidence level of 95\% for the mean quoted, the corresponding confidence interval is ${0.3775}<{\mu}<{0.6707}$.
